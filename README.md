  ### Kasual Tricot is a well-established brick-and-mortar store specializing in high-quality knitted clothing. Known for its stylish sweaters, scarves, and hats, Cozy Threads has built a loyal customer base locally. With growing demand and an opportunity to reach a

  ### Customer Accounts: Enable customers to create accounts for easier repeat purchases, order tracking, and personalized recommendations.
  ### Responsive Design: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
  ### Inventory Management: Integrate with inventory management to keep track of stock levels and update product availability in real-time.
